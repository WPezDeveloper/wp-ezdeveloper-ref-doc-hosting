Popular Webhosts in AWP
This is a list of web hosts that get positive reviews from AWP users regularly. There is ONE affiliate link in this whole thing and that is for WPEngine. The affiliate monies from that link go to support the San Diego AWP Meetup ONLY. Please do not add any additional affiliate links to this list. That would be grounds for being banned.

Shared Hosting
There are a plethora of cheap shared hosts around, and their support and quality vary a lot. But most AWP users are fairly secure in NOT recommending any host owned and/or operated by EIG. Here's a full list of those hosts:

As for recommendations, here's just a few:
A2 Hosting = http://www.a2hosting.com/
Dreamhost = http://www.dreamhost.com/
Hive Node =  http://www.hivenode.com/Previously Laris Hosting. PM Troy Glancy if you have questions.
TVC.Net = http://tvc.net/ PM Jim Walker. Solid State Drives (SSD), cPanel, free daily malware scanning, and nearly instant "expert" customer service. Long list of signed customer testimonials on website. @tvcnet, +tvcnet :: Benchmark speed test: http://goo.gl/5foiIa
Webfaction = https://www.webfaction.com/
Web Wizards = http://wpwebwizards.com/Offering hosting since 1997 - PM Rob Marlbrough with any questions.
ICDSoft = http://icdsoft.com (doesn't oversell servers)
Notes: 

Fully self managed (aka unmanaged) VPS / Dedicated servers require server admin experience and come with limited support.

Regarding GoDaddy (the pink elephant in the room), the jury is still out on them. They recently acquired Media Temple -- an excellent hosting company and on the list above. They have begun migrating their shared hosting sites to their "Grid" service which is far quicker than in previous years. So, though they are notorious for sharing 10,000+ sites on one stack, they have also made a lot of changes recently to their service and overall quality. But considering that each of the shared hosting options above are superior in most ways already, there's not a major incentive to start with them. Do so at your own risk.
